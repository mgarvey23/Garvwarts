## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be in the `dist` folder.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

The app is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the main/master branch.

**To enable GitHub Pages:**
1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment", select:
   - **Source**: GitHub Actions
4. Push your code to the main/master branch
5. The GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy
6. Your app will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/Garvwarts/`

**Manual deployment:**
```bash
npm run build
# Then deploy the dist/ folder to your hosting service
```

**Note**: The app uses localStorage, so each user's data is stored locally in their browser. For multi-device support, you'd need to add a backend like Firebase.

### Troubleshooting Deployment

**If you see "Multiple artifacts" error:**
1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. Find the failed workflow run
3. Click **Re-run all jobs** (top right)
4. The new workflow will cancel old runs automatically

**If deployment still fails:**
1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", ensure:
   - **Read and write permissions** is selected
   - **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** is checked
3. Save and re-run the workflow

**Common issues:**
- Forgot to enable GitHub Pages in Settings ‚Üí Pages
- Source is set to "Deploy from branch" instead of "GitHub Actions"
- Pushing to wrong branch (must be main or master)
- First deployment can take 2-5 minutes
